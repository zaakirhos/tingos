\vspace*{5mm}\par\textbf{Problem 1.} Perform a breadth-first search of the graph starting from vertex A.  Give the number of steps to reach \emph{every} other vertex.  Additionally, give the order in which the vertices are \emph{first} witnessed; that is, give the order in which they first enter the queue (and not necessarily the order in which they are explored).\par

\vspace*{10mm}\par\textbf{Problem 2.} Use Dijkstra's algorithm on this graph starting from vertex A.  Give the cost of the least-cost path to \emph{every} other vertex.  Additionally, give the order in which the vertices are \emph{first} witnessed; that is, give the order in which they first enter the equeue (and not necessarily the order in which they are explored).\par
